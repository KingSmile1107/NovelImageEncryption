# A novel color image encryption algorithm based on infinite collapse map and hierarchical strategy
 
Chaos-based image encryption algorithms are important for information security, but current chaotic systems and 
encryption algorithms still have optimization potential. This paper proposes a novel one-dimensional improved 
composite chaotic map (1D-ICCM) to enhance chaos performance and the efficiency of generating chaotic 
sequences. The dynamic characteristics of the 1D-ICCM are analyzed in depth, demonstrating favorable chaotic 
properties. Based on this, we introduce a hierarchical strategy image encryption algorithm (HS-IEA) that combines 
1D-ICCM and the Logistic map to improve the robustness and security of image encryption algorithms. The 
algorithm begins by integrating the image at the pixel level and performing secondary diffusion on the integrated 
sequence. After restoring the color channel matrices, the image is encrypted at the pixel level using bidirectional 
dynamic scrambling. Then, bit-plane decomposition is applied. To handle large amounts of data at the bit level, 
high-order and low-order bit planes are processed separately: high-order planes are encrypted using bit-level 
diffusion, while low-order planes use bit-plane rotation. Finally, the encrypted bit-planes and color channel 
matrices are merged for two-layer encryption. Experimental results and security evaluations confirm that the 
HS-IEA significantly improves image encryption’s robustness, security, and performance
